An embedded system that measures light intensity by using a primary sensor as a solar panel and a backup sensor as a photodiode.

Able to change sensors by using a simple push button.

The light intensity is displayed by using several seven-segment displays (single-character displays) minimum of four characters. 

When light intensity is less than 5000 lux, the 12 V light gets turn on.
